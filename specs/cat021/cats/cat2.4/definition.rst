Notes:

    1. Bit 3 indicates that the position reported by the target is
       within a credible range from the ground station. The range
       check is followed by the CPR validation to ensure that global
       and local position decoding both indicate valid position
       information. Bit 3=1 indicates that the range check was done,
       but the CPR validation is not yet completed.
       Once CPR validation is completed, Bit 3 will be reset to 0.
    2. The second extension signals the reasons for which the report has
       been indicated as suspect (indication Confidence Level (CL) in the
       first extension).
    3. Bit 2 indicates that the Range Check failed, i.e. the target is
       reported outside the credible range for the Ground Station. For
       operational users such a target will be suppressed. In services
       used for monitoring the Ground Station, the target will be
       transmitted with bit 2 indicating the fault condition.
    4. Bit 6, if set to 1, indicates that the position reported by the
       target was validated by an independent means and a discrepancy
       was detected. If no independent position check is implemented,
       the default value “0” is to be used.
    5. Bit 5 represents the setting of the GO/NOGO-bit as defined in
       item I023/100 of category 023 [Ref. 3].
    6. Bit 7, if set to 1, indicates that a lookup in a Black-list/White-list
       failed, indicating that the target may be suspect

Notes:

    1. Apart from the “PIC” item, all items are defined as per the
       respective link technology protocol version (“MOPS version”,
       see I021/210).
    2. The primary subfield is kept for backwards compatibility reasons.
       Version 2 NIC-values shall be mapped accordingly. This is required
       to ensure that downstream systems, which are not capable of
       interpreting extensions 2 and 3 (because they use an ASTERIX
       edition earlier than 2.0) still get the required information
    3. “Version 1” or “Version 2” refers to the MOPS version as defined
       in data item I021/210, bits 6/4
    4. “Version 2” refers to the MOPS version as defined in data item
       I021/210, bits 6/4
    5. PIC=0 is defined for completeness only. In this case the third
       extension shall not be generated.
    6. For ED102A/DO260B PIC values of 7 and 9, the NIC supplements
       for airborne messages (NIC supplements A/B) and surface messages
       (NIC supplements A/C) are listed.
       For ED102A/DO260B PIC=8, the NIC supplements A/B for airborne
       messages are listed.
       For DO260A PIC values of 7 and 8, the NIC supplement for airborne
       messages is shown in brackets.
       The aircraft air-ground status, and hence message type (airborne
       or surface), is derived from the GBS-bit in I021/040, 1 st extension.

        | 4: Not assigned
        | 5: Not assigned
        | 6: Not assigned
        | 7: Not assigned


Notes:

    - VN sub-field shall contain a value describing the MOPS used by each aircraft.
      The versions of other link technologies are assumed to be in line
      with the 1090 ES MOPS versions and the corresponding MASPS versions.

    - Bit 7 (VNS) when set to 1 indicates that the aircraft transmits a
      MOPS Version indication that is not supported by the Ground Station.
      However, since MOPS versions are supposed to be backwards compatible,
      the GS has attempted to interpret the message and achieved a credible
      result. The fact that the MOPS version received is not supported by
      the GS is submitted as additional information to subsequent processing
      systems.
