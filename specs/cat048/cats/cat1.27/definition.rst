    3. To bit 6 (XPP): This bit shall always be set when the X-pulse has
       been extracted, independent from the Mode it was extracted with.
    4. To bit 7 (ERR): This bit set to “1” indicates that the range of the
       target is beyond the maximum range in data item I048/040.In this
       case – and this case only - the ERR Data Item in the Reserved

Notes:

    1. It has to be stressed that a series of one or more codes can
       be reported per target report.
    2. Data conveyed in this item are of secondary importance, and
       can generally also be derived from the processing of mandatory items.
    3. Definitions can be found in SUR.ET1.ST03.1000-STD-01-01 Radar
       Sensor Performance Analysis.
    4. Values 25 to 30 have been defined to comply with the updated
       European Mode S Specification (EMS) and to provide the possibility
       to report the following information:

           - Code 25: the maximum number of permitted re-interrogations to
             acquire the surveillance information has been reached;
           - Code 26: the maximum number of permitted re-interrogations to
             extract BDS Registers has been reached;
           - Code 27: inconsistency detected between the contents of the
             message and the BDS register overlayed;
           - Code 28: a BDS swap has been detected and the respective information
             has been discarded;
           - Code 29: the track has been updated while being in the zenithal
             gap (also referred to as “Cone of Silence”);
           - Code 30: the radar had lost track of an aircraft and subsequently
             re-acquired it.

I048/040 - Measured Position in Polar Co-ordinates
**************************************************

*Definition*: Measured position of an aircraft in local polar co-ordinates.

*Structure*:

    **I048/040/RHO**

    - 16 bits [``................``]

    - unsigned quantity
    - scaling factor: 1
    - fractional bits: 8
    - unit: "NM"
    - LSB = :math:`1 / {2^{8}}` NM = :math:`1 / {256}` NM :math:`\approx 0.00390625` NM
    - value :math:`< 256` NM

    **I048/040/THETA**

    - 16 bits [``................``]

    - unsigned quantity
    - scaling factor: 360
    - fractional bits: 16
    - unit: "deg"
    - LSB = :math:`360 / {2^{16}}` deg = :math:`360 / {65536}` deg :math:`\approx 0.0054931640625` deg


Notes:

    1. In case of no detection, the extrapolated position expressed in slant
       polar co-ordinates may be sent, except for a track cancellation message.
       No detection is signalled by the TYP field set to zero in I048/020
       Target Report Descriptor.
    2. This item represents the measured target position of the plot, even
       if associated with a track, for the present antenna scan. It is
       expressed in polar co-ordinates in the local reference system,
       centred on the radar station.
    3. In case of combined detection by a PSR and an SSR, then the SSR
       position is sent.
    4. For targets having a range beyond the maximum range the data item
       “Extended Range Report” has been added to the Reserved Expansion
       Field of category 048. The presence of this data item is indicated
       by the ERR bit set to one in data item I048/020, first extension.
       The ERR data item shall only be sent if the value of RHO is equal
       to or greater than 256NM.
       Please note that if this data item is used, the Encoding Rule to
       data item I048/040 still applies, meaning that the extra item in
       the Reserved Expansion Field shall be transmitted in addition to
       data item I048/040.
       If the Extended Range Report item in the Reserved Expansion Field
       is used, it is recommended to set the value of RHO in data item
       I048/040 to its maximum, meaning bits 32/17 all set to 1.

Notes:

    1. When Mode C code / Mode S altitude code is present but not decodable,
       the “Undecodable Mode C code / Mode S altitude code” Warning/Error
       should be sent in I048/030.
    2. When local tracking is applied and the received Mode C code / Mode S
       altitude code corresponds to an abnormal value (the variation with
       the previous plot is estimated too important by the tracker),
       the “Mode C code / Mode S altitude code abnormal value compared
       to the track“ Warning/Error should be sent in I048/030.
    3. The value shall be within the range described by ICAO Annex 10
    4. For Mode S, bit 15 (G) is set to one when an error correction has
       been attempted.
