Note:

    1. There is now a new Item for the Position Accuracy defined in
       the Reserved Expansion Field (REF), more complete (includes a
       Standard Deviation of Position in WGS-84) and is based on a
       different calculation method (covariance instead of correlation).
       It is recommended to use the new definition. Nevertheless, Item
       I020/500 is kept in order to prevent a full incompatibility with
       previous releases of ASTERIX Cat. 020 already implemented.
