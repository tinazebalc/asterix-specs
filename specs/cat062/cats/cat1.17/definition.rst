Notes:

    1. Track type and coasting can also be derived from I062/290 System Track Update Ages
    2. If the system supports the technology, default value (0) means that the technology was used to produce the report
    3. If the system does not support the technology, default value is meaningless.
    4. Bits (EMS): other than subfield #11 of data item I062/380, these
       bits allow the SDPS to set the emergency indication as derived from
       other sources than ADS-B (e.g. based on the Mode 3/A code).
    5. Bit (PFT): with this flag an SDPS can indicate that internal
       processing points to the track being potentially false. Details on the
       internal processing are system dependent.
    6. Bit (FPLT): this bit - if set - indicates that the information contained
       in the target report has been updated by flight plan related data
       because no surveillance data was available for the target, or was
       created based on flight plan related data in areas with no
       surveillance.
    7. Bit (DUPT) is set to 1 if the correlation between the target report and a flight
       plan is not possible because the Mode 3/A code stated in the flight plan exists
       more than once in the surveillance data.
    8. Bit (DUPF) - if set to 1 - indicates that for a specific surveillance target more
       than one flight plan exists which makes correlation impossible.
    9. Bit (DUPM) is set to 1 if a target was correlated manually but also a regular
       flight plan exists.
    10. All tracks for which bits DUPT, DUPF or DUPM are set to 1 are marked on the CWP.

       bit set, then the Military Emergency bit (ME) in Data Item I062/080,
       Track Status, shall be set.
    3. If an authenticated Mode 5 reply is received with the Identification
       of Position bit set, then the Special Position Identification
       bit (SPI) in Data Item I062/080, Track Status, shall be set.
    4. The resolution implied by the LSB is better than the resolution
       with which Mode 5 position reports are transmitted from aircraft
       transponders using currently defined formats.
    5. GA is coded as a 14-bit two's complement binary number with
       an LSB of 25 ft. irrespective of the setting of RES.
    6. The minimum value of GA that can be reported is -1000 ft.

Notes:

    1. Despite there are now two subfields (#29 and #30) reporting the ages
       of, respectively, the Indicated Airspeed track data and the Mach
       Number track data, the subfield #8 (and so its presence bit , bit-32) is
       kept free in order to prevent a full incompatibility with previous
       releases of ASTERIX Cat. 062 already implemented.
    2. In all the subfields, the age is the time delay since the value was
       measured

       defined as the absolute time from midnight.
    6. TOV is meaningful only if TOA is set to 0
    7. Refer to ICAO Draft SARPs for ACAS for detailed explanations.
    8. A positive value represents a right turn, whereas a negative value
       represents a left turn.
    9. Value 15 means 15 degrees/s or above.
    10. Velocity uncertainty category of the least accurate velocity component
    11. Positive longitude indicates East. Positive latitude indicates North.

Notes:

    - The composed track number is used by co-operating units to uniquely
      identify a track. It consists of the unit identifier and system
      track number for each unit involved in the co-operation. The first
      unit identification identifies the unit that is responsible for the
      track amalgamation.
